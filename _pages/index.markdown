# About Me
Hello, my name is Thorn and I am a software engineer. I studied computer science at Stanford University from 2015 to 2019. In addition to that, I have 5 years of working experience as a software engineer. In 2019 I graduated from Stanford and joined Shippo, an API company that allows users to programmatically get shipping prices, create labels, and track packages. In November 2024 I decided to part ways with Shippo in order to get out of my comfort zone and to seek out and solve new problems.

# About This Site
This site aims to serve as a touch point for anyone who wants to get familiar with me professionally (and to an extent, personally.) I will be using this site to showcase a few things:
- Technical blogging
- Professional experience
- Personal life
- etc
