Welcome! This page serves as the first post to my new website, Thorn's Hall. Here, I'll be posting blog-style posts related to tech and my life. I also plan to eventually add tutorials and/or teaching guides for tech concepts. These guides will serve both as a resource to beginners and as a way for me to solidify my understanding of a subject. 

## Background
After working for 5 years at Shippo, I've decided to part ways with them and look for new opportunities. From this move sparked the idea for me to create my own website. This website is intended to serve as a repository of information about my career, skills,  and as a technical blog. 

### Technical Blog
I plan to write articles about technical topics in order to teach beginners as well as solidify my own understanding. Some ideas I have planned are: Introduction to Apache Kafka, Systems Design principles, and more.

### About Me (Personal)
I will be adding page(s) exploring my personal life, what path I took to get where I am today, and where I plan on going in the future. Please keep a lookout!

### About Me (Work Experience)
What use would a personal career website be without a section dedicated to work and professional experience? I will be adding a top-level page to give a wholistic view of me as an engineer.
